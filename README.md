This package can be used to annotate candidate target probe sequences
designed to label RNA in nuclei isolated from human postmortem brain for
flow cytometry. This package also includes functions that visualize
candidate sequence expression in four postmortem brain datasets that
address nuclear expression, effects of RNA degradation and flow
cytometric sorting, and cell type-specific expression to increase the
likelihood of success as a custom target probe. Please refer to the
BrainFlow publication or the [PrimeFlow RNA(TM) Assay
Kit](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/88-18005-204)
literature for more information.

## Documentation

For more information about `brainflowprobes` check the vignettes
